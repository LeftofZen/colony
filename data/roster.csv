2015,Alex Ladomatos,Pillage,31,"Possessing arguably the most serious attitude to frisbee since Ken Dobbyns in his prime, Lado's insane capacity for facial hair stylings keeps his opponents guessing.",DH
2015,Angus Keenan,Pillage,9,"Crashing on to the field on a wave of his own body hair, Gus Guy's signature offensive cuts such have been described as poetry in motion by men who know a lot about poetry, and also those who don't know that much but know a goddamn fantastic moustache when they see one.",OH
2015,Anthony Dowle,Pillage,4,"Anthony has been one of Australia's best receivers for more than a decade. He can also fit 45(!!!) grapes in his mouth. Of all the Colony 2015 squad, his skillset off the field is the one best suited to hunting the most dangerous game: humans.",OH
2015,Ben Sutas,Plunder,91,"Colony's standard repository of information about the wonderful world around us, Ben's unassuming extreme speed is only matched by his teammates' need for him to have a Twitter account.",OC
2015,Calan Spielman,Pillage,6,"The only player on the Colony squad to win a fight with a car by TKO. Gets active strength and agility bonuses to the tune of +15-18% when involved in rules discussions on-field - trigger him at your peril.",OH
2015,Chris Crimmins,Plunder,27,"Crimmo is Colony's most famous player as ascribed entirely by Buzzfeed metrics. If you don't know his face, you probably haven't been wasting enough time at work.",OH
2015,Dan Petrov,Pillage,3,"Colony's blazingly fast work experience kid. Along with his impressive photocopying experience, Dan also has wisdom beyond his years in knowing when to call it a night - at the start, before he has had any beer.",DC
2015,David Rountree,Plunder,26,"Vice-Captain of the Checking Line, Maple derived his nickname from an unfortunate accident in the Canadian woods during his student days in Quebec. The first player of many on Colony to be cured of bad throwing habits via vicious intra-team violence.",OH
2015,Drew Wiseham,Plunder,,"Boasting the most insane commute to training on the team, Drew's routine 120km cycle to practice has become a social media hit and a massive rallying point for change in Sydney's infrastructure. Straight out of Dapto, Drew remains oblivious to the sweeping changes made in Sydney's public transport system, such as the addition of trains, and cycles on.",OH
2015,Eshan Wickrema,Pillage,5,"The most extensively-researched costume department on the team, Eshan is also known for cutting his arm off at the shoulder whilst screaming 'you have failed me for the last time!'. Its replacement is going great guns though.",OH
2015,Gavin Moore,Plunder,1,"Historically the worst forehand since the invention of the forehand to ever carry a team to four consecutive national titles. Best beer fridge on the squad; the two have not been proven to be related.",OC
2015,Graeme Barber,Plunder,16,"Notorious for instigating the 2011 Vancouver Riots, Graeme has moved his life to Sydney in the vain hope of the heat dying down. Tormented by many demons.",OH
2015,James Yorston,Pillage,8,"When he first picked up a the disc, Papa JY's extensive experience as a famed performer in the Cirque de Soleil, the storied Australian Mens Synchronised Swimming Team, and the Australian Ballet all congealed perfectly into Australia's best forehand fake. Legendary within the team for his Hunter-Killer-esque Tournament Mode.",OH
2015,Jimmy Tod-Hill,Plunder,22,"A reformed goth and the most punk-rock poetry student on the team, Jimmy is certain to be found pre-game growling and frothing to himself before games. In the interests of the public, this is how he can be found outside of tournaments also.",DC
2015,Lucas Nicholls,Pillage,24,"With a capacity for spectacular reflex diving exceeded only by top Italian football players and reflexes honed by solid decades of first-person shooters, Lucas had almost given up trying to kill himself skateboarding before he found his new passion: trying to kill himself playing Ultimate.",OH
2015,Mark Evans,Plunder,14,"Colony's best-moisturised player, Mark is also the only non-player in the history of Ultimate to knock a team (Doublewide) out of pre-quarters at WUCC, earning him the formidable mantle of the Deadliest 8th Man in the sport.",OH
2015,Mark Taylor,Plunder,12,"Mark 'Tubby' Taylor is the only known Ultimate player to have a famous cricketer and terrible commentator retroactively nicknamed after them. Empirically rated as Australia's dreamiest player, in 2011 he came the closest of all Colony players yet to killing a man for a teammate.",OH
2015,Matt Dowle,Plunder,80,"Men want to be him. Ladies also want to be him. Matt Dowle is one of Australian Ultimate's most storied players, and with good reason - the guy is goddamn phenomenal at barefoot bowls.",OH

2015,Nathan Linforth,Plunder,13,"Also known as the Golden Gloves, some of Linny's claims to fame include that he runs his own swimwear line, and that his brother was Australia's most eligible bachelor. Speaks phenomenally efficient Swedish.",OH
2015,Nathan Stacey,Plunder,11,"Big Natey is known for going hard on night 1 of tournaments, and for every hour of the tournament thereafter. Also goes by the name of The Taipan when he is being extremely sick, and Possum when he is partaking in beer bongs as part of team hydration exercises.",OH
2015,Nick Dousset,Pillage,46,"Doomsday. The Closer. Doggy dog. Pooset. The Butcher. The Delegator. The Lord of Smells. 'Don't Send a Boy to do a Man's Job'. There is little to say about Nick that his array of nicknames cannot.",DC
2015,Oliver Dousset,Pillage,42,"Tricked by his brother into playing Ultimate. Still convinced that girls don't play, The O-man the frustration from Nick's devious trick out on unsuspecting handlers, proving time and again that The O-man cannot be messed with. Pillage's most fire Snapchat game.",DC
2015,Owen Shepherd,Plunder,21,"It is understood that Owen uses competitive Ultimate teams as a front to peddle cleats at 'unbelievable' prices. At some point in the process, he stumbled into being a really excellent player. Business is good.",DH
2015,Paul Denyer,Pillage,36,"The first Ultimate player to be selected for a competitive team in the position of defensive linebacker, The Captain of the Checking Line's extreme ticker is only tempered by his erratic ability to board buses, trains and planes correctly. Expect to see him at least by day 3 of AUC",OH
2015,Peter Blakeley,Plunder,23,"Tex 'Peter' Blakeley is famed across this great red land for his ability to turn outrageously overshot or overlofted hucks into certain goals, and sure goals into heart-in-mouth bobble drops.",OH
2015,Peter Liddicoat,Plunder,88,"A mad scientist nicknamed after the entrepid protagonist of a Belgian comic, TinTin has taken the musical adaptation of his PhD to Broadway and beyond, having performed his lauded number on nanostructural architecture over one hundred times last year. Back in town for a brief period of what this darling of stage and screen would call rest, and others would call an emotionally and physically draining season, he brings proven star power to an already immaculately-cast team.",OH
2015,Rob Andrews,Pillage,25,"The quickest moves on the field and slowest off, the pride of the Northern Beaches realised his destiny at fourteen - becoming far cooler than his older brother - and since then has entertained himself with other, more mellow pursuits.",OH
2015,Rory Connell,Pillage,60,"A known Satanist in the kitchen and a significant majority stake in both Colony's banter export and beef consumption, Rory has never looked off an opportunity to spike a disc in his life and has no intent of doing so in future.
",OC
2015,Sam Ogden,Pillage,64,"Colony's longest-milked PhD, Sam is also known for having at least one video game cheat code tattooed on his leg. His other leg sports an array of algorithm-predicted Eastbay discount coupons.",OH
2015,Sebastian Hardy,Pillage,15,"Don't look him in the eyes.",OH
2015,Thomas Vo,Plunder,53,"Would be considered a much better player in the Australian Ultimate scene if he didn't run his mouth so much. An arrogant player who plays with staggering swagger, TVO is used to great effect by Colony to distract opponents from quieter, more humble workhorses such as Mark Evans and Jimmy Tod-Hill. ",DC
2015,Will Norton,Pillage,41,"Boasting the strongest Mongolian blood on the team, Genghis Norton is Pillage's Banter Captain. Miscreants be warned: as Spirit Captain at WUCC2014, he became known for finishing fights, not starting them.",OH
2015,Xavier Black,Plunder,17,"Also known as the Dark Slumberer, Xavier's last name was changed to 'Black' from 'Voodoo' to reflect his preferred school of sorcery. Of all Colony's players, Xavier is the most attuned to the whimsies of the Aether, and hence possesses a bag of tricks on-field that it would drive you mad to see the bottom of.",OH
2015,Yew Eng Ng,Pillage, 66,"Subject of the most half-arsed rumours on the Australian scene, Yewie's reputation thankfully does not precede him. His heart-stirring valiance and perseverance in trying to make the salad bowl happen is an example to us all.",OH
